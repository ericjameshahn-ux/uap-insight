  // EXISTENCE & NATURE (1-20)
  { id: 1, question: "Are we alone in the universe?", answer: "Multiple credentialed officials have stated they believe the answer is 'no.' Col. Karl Nell stated there is 'zero doubt' that non-human intelligence is interacting with humanity. Former CIA Director John Brennan suggested UAP 'might constitute a different form of life.'", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Karl Nell", "John Brennan"], relatedSections: ["A"] },
  { id: 2, question: "Are UAP definitely extraterrestrial (from other planets)?", answer: "Not necessarily. Officials have proposed alternatives: interdimensional beings, time-travelers (future humans), cryptoterrestrials (hidden Earth civilization), or ultraterrestrials. David Grusch used careful language like 'non-human intelligence' rather than 'alien.'", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["I"] },
  { id: 3, question: "Could UAP be 'us from the future' traveling back in time?", answer: "This is a serious hypothesis. Dr. Michael Masters argues that UAP occupant morphology (large heads, small bodies) is consistent with projected human evolution. If time travel becomes possible, future humans might visit pivotal moments.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "J"] },
  { id: 4, question: "Is it possible UAP are just secret US military technology?", answer: "AARO has suggested some sightings may be classified US programs. However, whistleblowers explicitly deny this, stating the performance characteristics exceed any known human physics. The Nimitz 2004 encounter showed capabilities decades beyond current technology.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["B", "C"] },
  { id: 5, question: "Could they be adversaries like China or Russia?", answer: "Intelligence assessments generally rule this out. Former DNI John Ratcliffe stated these objects demonstrate 'technologies that we don't have and that we are not capable of defending against.' Senator Romney noted that 'China and Russia just aren't there.'", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["John Ratcliffe"], relatedSections: ["A"] },
  { id: 6, question: "What is the 'Interdimensional Hypothesis'?", answer: "The idea that UAP may project into our 3D reality from higher spatial dimensions, similar to how a 3D object passing through a 2D plane would appear to 'pop' in and out of existence. Grusch has referenced the Holographic Principle from physics.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "J"] },
  { id: 7, question: "What are the 'Five Observables'?", answer: "Characteristics documented by military sensors: (1) Instantaneous acceleration, (2) Hypersonic velocity without sonic boom, (3) Low observability on radar, (4) Transmedium travel between air/water/space, (5) Positive lift with no visible propulsion.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["C"] },
  { id: 8, question: "Do these objects actually have pilots?", answer: "David Grusch testified under oath that the US has recovered 'non-human biologics' from crash sites. Historical cases like Roswell and Varginha also describe recovered beings. Some craft may be autonomous or remotely piloted.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["G", "K"] },
  { id: 9, question: "What is the 'Sixth Observable'?", answer: "Biological effects on human observers. Close encounters often result in radiation burns, neurological changes, and lasting health impacts. Dr. Garry Nolan found increased density in the caudate-putamen brain region of experiencers.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Garry Nolan"], relatedSections: ["I", "K"] },
  { id: 10, question: "Is the phenomenon ancient?", answer: "Evidence suggests UAP have been observed throughout human history. Jacques Vallée documented parallels between modern UFO encounters and historical accounts of 'fairy folk,' religious apparitions, and airship sightings.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Jacques Vallée"], relatedSections: ["D"] },
  { id: 11, question: "Are 'Orbs' the same as structured craft?", answer: "Orbs are one of the most commonly reported UAP types. Some theories suggest they are scanning drones, plasmoids, or probe vehicles. AARO director noted metallic orbs are seen 'all over the world' making 'very interesting apparent maneuvers.'", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 12, question: "Can UAP manipulate human consciousness?", answer: "Multiple accounts describe telepathic communication. Dr. Italo Venturelli claimed telepathic contact with a being during the Varginha incident. Experiencers frequently report 'downloads' of information or feeling their thoughts were read.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "K"] },
  { id: 13, question: "What is the 'Hitchhiker Effect'?", answer: "A phenomenon where paranormal activity 'follows' UAP witnesses home. Documented at Skinwalker Ranch, investigators reported poltergeist activity and strange occurrences after engaging with the phenomenon.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I"] },
  { id: 14, question: "Are they angels or demons?", answer: "Some interpret UAP through religious frameworks. A faction within government called the 'Collins Elite' allegedly believes UAP are demonic. The Vatican has studied the phenomenon. Others see these as projections of human expectation.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "M"] },
  { id: 15, question: "Why do UAP look different in different decades?", answer: "Dr. Diana Pasulka and Jacques Vallée suggest the phenomenon may adapt its appearance to cultural expectations—'ghost rockets' in the 1940s, flying saucers in the 1950s, black triangles in the 1990s.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Diana Pasulka", "Jacques Vallée"], relatedSections: ["D"] },
  { id: 16, question: "Is there a connection between UAP and nuclear sites?", answer: "Extensively documented. UAP have been observed over nuclear facilities worldwide, sometimes shutting down missile systems (Malmstrom AFB 1967). This pattern suggests deliberate monitoring of nuclear capabilities.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["D", "E"] },
  { id: 17, question: "Do UAP come from underwater?", answer: "USOs (Unidentified Submerged Objects) are well-documented. The Nimitz Tic Tac was tracked emerging from the ocean. Claims exist of underwater bases and craft entering/exiting water at high speed without cavitation.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["B", "E"] },
  { id: 18, question: "Do they have a hive mind?", answer: "Some behaviors suggest coordinated swarm intelligence. Kevin Day described UAP descending in formation 'like it was raining UFOs.' Swarms of orbs have been documented moving in synchronized patterns.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Kevin Day"], relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 19, question: "Is it true craft have no visible seams or rivets?", answer: "Consistently reported. Witnesses describe craft as seamless, as if grown rather than manufactured. Bob Lazar described the S-4 craft as having no sharp edges or welds—possibly 3D atomic printing or biological growth.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Bob Lazar"], relatedSections: ["C", "G"] },
  { id: 20, question: "Are the 'Greys' biological robots?", answer: "Some hypotheses suggest the typical 'Grey' alien may be an engineered avatar, biological drone, or 'suit' rather than an actual species. This could explain their uniformity in many accounts.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["K"] },

  // GOVERNMENT & PROGRAMS (21-40)
  { id: 21, question: "Does the US government possess crashed alien craft?", answer: "Dr. James Lacatski, who managed the $22M AAWSAP program, confirmed with Pentagon clearance that the US 'possesses a craft of unknown origin and successfully gained access to its interior.' David Grusch testified similarly under oath.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["James Lacatski", "David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["G"] },
  { id: 22, question: "What is the 'Legacy Program'?", answer: "The term used by David Grusch for the alleged multi-decade crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.

  { id: 24, question: "What is 'Kona Blue'?", answer: "A proposed DHS program to study UAP reverse engineering that was officially cancelled. However, Dr. Lacatski stated in November 2024 that it is 'alive in ways you won't believe.'", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["James Lacatski"], relatedSections: ["F", "G"] },
  { id: 25, question: "What is the difference between AATIP and AAWSAP?", answer: "AAWSAP was the official $22M program (2008-2010) with broad scope. AATIP was either a nickname or a narrower military-focused subset. Luis Elizondo ran AATIP.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["Luis Elizondo", "James Lacatski"], relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 26, question: "Did the US recover a craft in Italy in 1933?", answer: "David Grusch testified that a craft was recovered in Magenta, Italy in 1933 under Mussolini's regime, studied by Italian scientists, and transferred to the US in 1944 with Vatican assistance.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["D", "G"] },
  { id: 27, question: "What is the 'Wilson-Davis Memo'?", answer: "Notes allegedly from a 2002 meeting between Admiral Thomas Wilson and Dr. Eric Davis. Wilson reportedly described being denied access to a UAP reverse-engineering program despite his senior position.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["Eric Davis"], relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 28, question: "Does the Department of Energy have the craft?", answer: "David Grusch claims some materials are hidden under Atomic Energy Act 'Restricted Data' classifications, which would place them under DOE jurisdiction rather than DOD.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 29, question: "Is there a 'secret space program'?", answer: "Claims exist of a 'breakaway civilization' with advanced technology. Catherine Austin Fitts documents $21 trillion in 'undocumented adjustments' that could fund such programs.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["Catherine Austin Fitts"], relatedSections: ["H", "L"] },
  { id: 30, question: "Does the President know the truth?", answer: "Presidents are often allegedly denied 'need to know' access to waived SAPs. Bill Clinton said he 'wouldn't be the first president that underlings had lied to.'", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["Bill Clinton"], relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 31, question: "Are private aerospace companies holding the craft?", answer: "Frequently alleged. Lockheed Martin is most often named. The Schumer Amendment attempted to use eminent domain to recover 'technology of unknown origin' from private hands.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["G", "H"] },
  { id: 32, question: "What role does the Vatican play?", answer: "Grusch claims the Vatican assisted in transferring the 1933 Magenta craft to the US. The Vatican has made statements about extraterrestrial life being compatible with Catholic theology.", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["D", "M"] },
  { id: 33, question: "Have UAP tampered with nuclear weapons?", answer: "Documented at multiple sites.

Similar events occurred at Soviet facilities.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["D", "E"] },
  { id: 34, question: "What is AARO and is it effective?", answer: "The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, created in 2022. Whistleblowers accuse it of finding nothing. However, current director Jon Kosloski has acknowledged cases he 'cannot explain.'", theme: "government", relatedFigures: ["Jon Kosloski"], relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 35, question: "Did the CIA conduct a crash retrieval in Brazil?", answer: "Testimony suggests US involvement in the 1996 Varginha incident. A police officer who handled a being died within weeks from an 'unidentified toxin.'", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["E", "K"] },
  { id: 36, question: "Has the US government communicated with NHI?", answer: "Some claims suggest diplomatic contact or 'agreements.' These remain in the LOWER credibility tier. However, reverse-engineering programs imply some understanding of the technology's origins.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["G", "K"] },
  { id: 37, question: "What is 'Project Moon Dust'?", answer: "A historical Air Force project to recover foreign space debris. Declassified documents show it was sometimes invoked for UAP recoveries, providing official cover.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["D", "G"] },
  { id: 38, question: "Who are the 'Gatekeepers'?", answer: "Specific individuals alleged to control access to UAP programs and block disclosure. These career officials allegedly maintain the cover-up across administrations.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 39, question: "What is 'Sentient' AI?", answer: "An alleged NRO system claimed to autonomously detect and quarantine UAP data before human analysts can see it—automated suppression at the collection level.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 40, question: "Is there international cooperation on UAP secrecy?", answer: "The 'Five Eyes' alliance allegedly coordinates UAP policy. Some researchers believe a global agreement prevents any single nation from disclosure.", theme: "government", relatedSections: ["E", "F"] },

  // SECRECY & COVER-UP (41-50)
  { id: 41, question: "Why is the government keeping this secret?", answer: "Multiple reasons: preventing 'ontological shock,' maintaining technological advantage, avoiding panic about biological threats, protecting religious institutions, and shielding illegal programs.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 42, question: "How can they hide such a big secret?", answer: "Through 'Waived Special Access Programs,' compartmentalization, the Atomic Energy Act classification system, contractor IRAD funding, and manufactured stigma that discourages inquiry.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 43, question: "What is the 'Atomic Energy Act of 1954'?", answer: "A legal tool allegedly exploited to classify UAP propulsion as 'Restricted Data' (originally for nuclear secrets). This places materials under DOE jurisdiction.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 44, question: "What is 'IRAD' and how is it used?", answer: "Independent Research and Development—funding that defense contractors can allocate without itemized disclosure. Allegedly used to bury UAP reverse-engineering costs in overhead.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["H"] },
  { id: 45, question: "Are people killed to keep the secret?", answer: "David Grusch testified he was informed of people being 'harmed or killed' to protect UAP secrecy.
