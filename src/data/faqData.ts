  // EXISTENCE & NATURE (1-20)
  { id: 1, question: "Are we alone in the universe?", answer: "Multiple credentialed officials have stated they believe the answer is 'no.' Col. Karl Nell stated there is 'zero doubt' that non-human intelligence is interacting with humanity. Former CIA Director John Brennan suggested UAP 'might constitute a different form of life.'", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Karl Nell", "John Brennan"], relatedSections: ["A"] },
  { id: 2, question: "Are UAP definitely extraterrestrial (from other planets)?", answer: "Not necessarily. Officials have proposed alternatives: interdimensional beings, time-travelers (future humans), cryptoterrestrials (hidden Earth civilization), or ultraterrestrials. David Grusch used careful language like 'non-human intelligence' rather than 'alien.'", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["I"] },
  { id: 3, question: "Could UAP be 'us from the future' traveling back in time?", answer: "This is a serious hypothesis. Dr. Michael Masters argues that UAP occupant morphology (large heads, small bodies) is consistent with projected human evolution. If time travel becomes possible, future humans might visit pivotal moments.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "J"] },
  { id: 4, question: "Is it possible UAP are just secret US military technology?", answer: "AARO has suggested some sightings may be classified US programs. However, whistleblowers explicitly deny this, stating the performance characteristics exceed any known human physics. The Nimitz 2004 encounter showed capabilities decades beyond current technology.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["B", "C"] },
  { id: 5, question: "Could they be adversaries like China or Russia?", answer: "Intelligence assessments generally rule this out. Former DNI John Ratcliffe stated these objects demonstrate 'technologies that we don't have and that we are not capable of defending against.' Senator Romney noted that 'China and Russia just aren't there.'", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["John Ratcliffe"], relatedSections: ["A"] },
  { id: 6, question: "What is the 'Interdimensional Hypothesis'?", answer: "The idea that UAP may project into our 3D reality from higher spatial dimensions, similar to how a 3D object passing through a 2D plane would appear to 'pop' in and out of existence. Grusch has referenced the Holographic Principle from physics.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "J"] },
  { id: 7, question: "What are the 'Five Observables'?", answer: "Characteristics documented by military sensors: (1) Instantaneous acceleration, (2) Hypersonic velocity without sonic boom, (3) Low observability on radar, (4) Transmedium travel between air/water/space, (5) Positive lift with no visible propulsion.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["C"] },
  { id: 8, question: "Do these objects actually have pilots?", answer: "David Grusch testified under oath that the US has recovered 'non-human biologics' from crash sites.

Experiencers frequently report 'downloads' of information or feeling their thoughts were read.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "K"] },
  { id: 13, question: "What is the 'Hitchhiker Effect'?", answer: "A phenomenon where paranormal activity 'follows' UAP witnesses home. Documented at Skinwalker Ranch, investigators reported poltergeist activity and strange occurrences after engaging with the phenomenon.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I"] },
  { id: 14, question: "Are they angels or demons?", answer: "Some interpret UAP through religious frameworks. A faction within government called the 'Collins Elite' allegedly believes UAP are demonic. The Vatican has studied the phenomenon. Others see these as projections of human expectation.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["I", "M"] },
  { id: 15, question: "Why do UAP look different in different decades?", answer: "Dr. Diana Pasulka and Jacques Vallée suggest the phenomenon may adapt its appearance to cultural expectations—'ghost rockets' in the 1940s, flying saucers in the 1950s, black triangles in the 1990s.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Diana Pasulka", "Jacques Vallée"], relatedSections: ["D"] },
  { id: 16, question: "Is there a connection between UAP and nuclear sites?", answer: "Extensively documented. UAP have been observed over nuclear facilities worldwide, sometimes shutting down missile systems (Malmstrom AFB 1967). This pattern suggests deliberate monitoring of nuclear capabilities.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["D", "E"] },
  { id: 17, question: "Do UAP come from underwater?", answer: "USOs (Unidentified Submerged Objects) are well-documented. The Nimitz Tic Tac was tracked emerging from the ocean. Claims exist of underwater bases and craft entering/exiting water at high speed without cavitation.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["B", "E"] },
  { id: 18, question: "Do they have a hive mind?", answer: "Some behaviors suggest coordinated swarm intelligence. Kevin Day described UAP descending in formation 'like it was raining UFOs.' Swarms of orbs have been documented moving in synchronized patterns.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Kevin Day"], relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 19, question: "Is it true craft have no visible seams or rivets?", answer: "Consistently reported. Witnesses describe craft as seamless, as if grown rather than manufactured. Bob Lazar described the S-4 craft as having no sharp edges or welds—possibly 3D atomic printing or biological growth.", theme: "existence", relatedFigures: ["Bob Lazar"], relatedSections: ["C", "G"] },
  { id: 20, question: "Are the 'Greys' biological robots?", answer: "Some hypotheses suggest the typical 'Grey' alien may be an engineered avatar, biological drone, or 'suit' rather than an actual species. This could explain their uniformity in many accounts.", theme: "existence", relatedSections: ["K"] },

  // GOVERNMENT & PROGRAMS (21-40)
  { id: 21, question: "Does the US government possess crashed alien craft?", answer: "Dr. James Lacatski, who managed the $22M AAWSAP program, confirmed with Pentagon clearance that the US 'possesses a craft of unknown origin and successfully gained access to its interior.'

  { id: 47, question: "What was the 'Robertson Panel'?", answer: "A 1953 CIA panel that recommended 'debunking' UFOs to reduce public interest. It explicitly called for using mass media to reduce credibility of sightings.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["D", "F"] },
  { id: 48, question: "Why did the Condon Report dismiss UFOs?", answer: "The 1969 study was allegedly designed to provide cover to close Project Blue Book. Internal memos showed the conclusion was predetermined. Yet 30% of cases remained unexplained.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["D"] },
  { id: 49, question: "Is 'AARO' a cover-up?", answer: "Whistleblowers have accused AARO of being designed to find nothing. The truth may be that AARO genuinely investigates but lacks access to the most sensitive legacy programs.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 50, question: "What is 'administrative terrorism'?", answer: "The use of security clearance revocations, career destruction, and bureaucratic harassment to punish whistleblowers. This creates a chilling effect.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },

  // SECRECY & COVER-UP continued (51-60)
  { id: 51, question: "Why won't they release the radar data?", answer: "Radar data is classified because it reveals the resolution and capabilities of US sensor platforms—information adversaries could exploit. This legitimate security concern conveniently also prevents UAP verification.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 52, question: "Why did the Schumer Amendment fail?", answer: "The UAP Disclosure Act was opposed by defense contractors and their Congressional allies. It would have created eminent domain authority to seize 'technology of unknown origin' from private hands.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 53, question: "Is the stigma manufactured?", answer: "Yes, explicitly. The Robertson Panel recommended using media to associate UFOs with 'kooks and nuts.' This deliberate campaign succeeded in making the topic professionally dangerous.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 54, question: "Are NDAs binding if the program is illegal?", answer: "Whistleblowers argue that NDAs for illegal programs are void. Dillon Guthrie's Yale presentation established that no one has ever been prosecuted for disclosing to Congress in private.", theme: "secrecy", relatedFigures: ["Dillon Guthrie"], relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 55, question: "Do we have a 'truth and reconciliation' plan?", answer: "Proposed but not implemented. Some legislators have suggested amnesty for insiders who come forward, similar to post-apartheid South Africa.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 56, question: "Is the cover-up global?", answer: "Evidence suggests international coordination. The Five Eyes alliance shares UAP data. Some researchers believe a global agreement prevents unilateral disclosure.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["E", "F"] },
  { id: 57, question: "Why did they hide the Varginha incident?", answer: "Allegedly to contain a biological threat. A police officer who handled a being died within weeks. The rapid US response suggests protocols exist for international crash retrieval.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["E", "K"] },
  { id: 58, question: "What is FASAB 56?", answer: "A 2018 accounting standard that allows federal agencies to 'modify' financial statements for national security. Catherine Austin Fitts argues this legalizes financial secrecy for UAP programs.", theme: "secrecy", relatedFigures: ["Catherine Austin Fitts"], relatedSections: ["H"] },
  { id: 59, question: "Can Congress force disclosure?", answer: "Theoretically yes—Congress has constitutional authority over appropriations and oversight. However, waived SAPs can legally exclude most members. Recent legislation attempts to close loopholes.", theme: "secrecy", relatedSections: ["F"] },
  { id: 60, question: "What would it take to maintain this secret?", answer: "Fewer people than you'd think. Compartmentalization means most participants don't know the big picture.

  // EVIDENCE & SCIENCE (61-80)
  { id: 61, question: "Is there any 'hard' evidence?", answer: "Yes. Recovered materials with anomalous isotopic ratios have been studied. Alleged crash debris shows manufacturing processes unlike any known Earth technology. Chain of custody issues complicate verification.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["G"] },
  { id: 62, question: "Can these craft fly without engines?", answer: "They allegedly use 'metric engineering'—warping spacetime itself rather than pushing against air. This would explain silent operation, instant acceleration, and lack of visible propulsion.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["C", "J"] },
  { id: 63, question: "What is the 'Pais Effect'?", answer: "Navy patents by Dr. Salvatore Pais describe reducing inertial mass using high-energy electromagnetic fields. While mainstream physics is skeptical, the Navy funded the research.", theme: "evidence", relatedFigures: ["Salvatore Pais"], relatedSections: ["J"] },
  { id: 64, question: "What is a 'terahertz waveguide'?", answer: "Micro-layered materials allegedly found in crash debris that may guide extremely high-frequency electromagnetic energy. These suggest manufacturing precision at the atomic level.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["G", "J"] },
  { id: 65, question: "Why are the photos always blurry?", answer: "High-resolution photos exist but are classified. Additionally, some craft reportedly distort light around them (part of their propulsion), making sharp photography physically difficult.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["B", "F"] },
  { id: 66, question: "Can UAP travel through water?", answer: "Yes—they are 'transmedium.' The Nimitz Tic Tac was tracked entering/exiting the ocean. Reports describe craft traveling ~500 mph underwater without cavitation. This violates known physics.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["B", "C"] },
  { id: 67, question: "How do they accelerate so fast?", answer: "By allegedly reducing inertial mass to near zero. Inside a warp bubble, the craft isn't accelerating through space—space itself is moving. This allows instant direction changes without g-forces.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["C", "J"] },
  { id: 68, question: "Do we have biological evidence?", answer: "David Grusch testified to the recovery of 'non-human biologics.' The Varginha incident allegedly produced samples. However, this evidence remains classified and unverified publicly.", theme: "evidence", relatedFigures: ["David Grusch"], relatedSections: ["G", "K"] },
  { id: 69, question: "Are there brain abnormalities in witnesses?", answer: "Dr. Garry Nolan found increased density in the caudate-putamen region of experiencers' brains.

  { id: 70, question: "Is the 'Tic Tac' video real?", answer: "Confirmed authentic by the Pentagon. The FLIR footage shows an object with no visible wings, exhaust, or control surfaces performing maneuvers beyond any known aircraft.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 71, question: "Why don't they create sonic booms?", answer: "A warp bubble would isolate the craft from atmosphere. The craft isn't moving through air—it's carrying a bubble of spacetime. No air interaction means no sonic boom.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["C", "J"] },
  { id: 72, question: "What are 'fastwalkers'?", answer: "UAP tracked by NORAD and DSP satellites entering Earth's atmosphere from deep space at high velocity. Distinct from satellites or meteors based on trajectories and behavior.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 73, question: "Can we 'summon' UAP?", answer: "Groups like Skywatcher claim protocols that trigger sightings using electronic signals and consciousness-based methods. They report consistent results and claim AARO personnel have observed operations.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["I"] },
  { id: 74, question: "Do UAP emit radiation?", answer: "Close encounters often result in radiation-like injuries—burns, hair loss, nausea. The Cash-Landrum incident (1980) caused severe health effects. This suggests high-energy emissions.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["C", "K"] },
  { id: 75, question: "What is the '1.6 GHz' signal?", answer: "A radio frequency reportedly detected during multiple UAP events. Some researchers believe this relates to craft operation or communication. Significance remains under investigation.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["C"] },
  { id: 76, question: "Are the 'spheres' drones?", answer: "Hypothesized to be an automated global monitoring network. Metallic orbs are the most commonly reported UAP type worldwide. Uniform appearance suggests a single source.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 77, question: "Can we detect them in orbit?", answer: "Dr. Beatriz Villarroel found 'transients'—objects in old astronomical plates that vanish from modern images. Some may be UAP photographed before we knew to look.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["B"] },
  { id: 78, question: "What would prove this is real?", answer: "Publicly released radar data with chain of custody, peer-reviewed material analysis, or official craft disclosure. Each has barriers: classification, contamination, political will.", theme: "evidence", relatedSections: ["A", "B", "G"] },
  { id: 79, question: "Is Element 115 real?", answer: "Yes—Moscovium (element 115) was synthesized in 2003, confirming Bob Lazar's 1989 claim. However, lab isotopes are unstable. Lazar claimed craft used a stable isotope.", theme: "evidence", relatedFigures: ["Bob Lazar"], relatedSections: ["J"] },
  { id: 80, question: "Why did Navy experiments fail to prove the Pais Effect?", answer: "They couldn't achieve the necessary energy density. The theory may be correct but beyond current engineering—like fusion theory proven decades before practical reactors.", theme: "evidence", relatedFigures: ["Salvatore Pais"], relatedSections: ["J"] },

  // IMPLICATIONS & FUTURE (81-100)
  { id: 81, question: "What is 'Ontological Shock'?", answer: "The psychological trauma of realizing humanity is not the apex intelligence. Studies suggest many would struggle to integrate this knowledge, potentially causing mental health crises or despair.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["M"] },
  { id: 82, question: "Will disclosure destroy religion?", answer: "Probably not. The Vatican and other faiths are preparing theology that integrates NHI. Some traditions already include non-human intelligences. Disclosure may challenge literalist interpretations.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["M"] },
  { id: 83, question: "Could this solve the energy crisis?", answer: "Potentially. If the propulsion physics can be replicated, it implies access to enormous energy densities—possibly zero-point energy or compact fusion. This could obsolete fossil fuels.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["J", "L"] },

  { id: 87, question: "Are we in a 'zoo'?", answer: "The 'Zoo Hypothesis' suggests advanced civilizations observe primitives without interference—like wildlife preserves. This could explain why contact is indirect.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["M"] },
  { id: 88, question: "What is the 'Sol Foundation'?", answer: "An academic organization preparing for disclosure's societal implications. Founded by Dr. Garry Nolan and Peter Skafish, it brings together scientists, philosophers, and policymakers.", theme: "implications", relatedFigures: ["Garry Nolan"], relatedSections: ["M"] },
  { id: 89, question: "Will there be 'Catastrophic Disclosure'?", answer: "A sudden uncontrolled leak causing chaos—versus 'managed disclosure' that prepares the public gradually. Some believe current information drip IS managed disclosure.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["F", "M"] },
  { id: 90, question: "Can we travel to the stars?", answer: "If the physics are mastered, yes. Alcubierre-style warp drives could make interstellar travel feasible, transforming humanity into a spacefaring civilization.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["J", "L"] },
  { id: 91, question: "Is consciousness fundamental?", answer: "UAP behavior and psi phenomena suggest consciousness may be more fundamental than matter—a basic feature of reality, not emergent from brains. This aligns with some quantum interpretations.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["I", "J"] },
  { id: 92, question: "What is 'The Program'?", answer: "Colloquial term for the overall cover-up infrastructure—SAPs, contractors, gatekeepers, and disinformation operations maintaining UAP secrecy across decades.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["F", "H"] },
  { id: 93, question: "Are there 'agreements' with NHI?", answer: "Persistent rumors suggest treaties involving technology transfer. This remains in the LOWER credibility tier—sensational but unverified by credentialed sources.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["K"] },
  { id: 94, question: "What happens in 2027?", answer: "CIA sources like John Ramirez have mentioned 2027 as significant—possibly a disclosure deadline or anticipated event. The specific basis remains unclear.", theme: "implications", relatedSections: ["M"] },
